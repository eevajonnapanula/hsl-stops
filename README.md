# HSL-stops

A React app to show when vehicle arrives on HSL-stop. It uses [Digitransit Routing API](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/1-routing-api/) for data, [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/) for GraphQL-client and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) for styling components.

## Planned TODO
- [ ] Get nearest stops
